                                <h1>Part 1: Introduction to Avalanches</h1>
                                <p>Avalanches are one of the most powerful and sudden natural disasters that occur in snowy mountainous regions. They happen when a mass of snow, ice, and sometimes debris slides down a mountain slope, posing significant risks to life and property. But what exactly triggers avalanches, and why are they so destructive?</p>
                    
                                <h2>What Are Avalanches?</h2>
                                <p>At their core, avalanches are the rapid flow of snow down a slope. They are typically triggered when the weight of the snowpack exceeds the strength of the snow layer beneath it. This imbalance can be caused by a variety of factors, including fresh snowfall, warming temperatures, and human activity.</p>
                    
                                <h2>Why Do Avalanches Occur?</h2>
                                <p>Avalanches occur in mountainous areas where there is a significant accumulation of snow. Several factors can contribute to avalanche formation, such as steep slopes, weak layers in the snowpack, and a trigger like heavy snowfall or an earthquake.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Slope Angle:</strong> Slopes between 30° and 45° are most prone to avalanches.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Snowpack Conditions:</strong> A weak layer of snow beneath a heavier, newer layer can lead to avalanches.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> A natural or human-caused disturbance that causes the snow to start moving downhill.</li>
                                </ul>
                    
                                <h2>The Importance of Understanding Avalanches</h2>
                                <p>Studying avalanches is crucial for minimizing their impact on human activities. Understanding where and how avalanches occur helps in developing avalanche prediction models, preparing safety measures for at-risk areas, and educating the public about avalanche safety.</p>
